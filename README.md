## How to run
### Runnig
1. Prepare `.env` file (You will do it only 1 time). See `example.env` file and fill `.env` file, or run program with `env` params.

2. Prepare `data.csv` file. Example:
```csv
EMAIL,name,TEMPLATE_FILE,SUBJECT
example@example.com,Dias1c,templates/example.html,My Example subject
example@example.com,MyName,templates/example.text,Text letter
example@example.com,,,
```
> Explaining. We will use this file for template to fill it and send it to emails. This file is `csv` type, and first line contains only `keys`, and all next lines contains values to `keys`.

Variable Keys:
- `EMAIL` - user email and variable
- `name` - variable
- `TEMPLATE_FILE` - template file path and variable
- `SUBJECT` - subject of letter and variable

> Program uses go builtin [`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template), [`html/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) packages.

3. Run:
The program for sending letters based on the submitted data
```bash
# By default uses `data.csv` file for sending letters or use flag  --data-file="YOUR_DATA_FILE"  
go run ./cmd/quick/main.go
```

On running program, it uses params. And this params we can set from different ways. Params also has priority.
Priority of params from:
```md
1. Data file
2. Args
3. .env file
```
> If we set `subject` as flag argument, and set it in `data.csv` file, program will use `subject` from `data.csv`.
